My name is Maxim Lisnic and I am a Ph.D. student in Human-Centered
Computing at the University of Utah's
[Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/). I
am advised by [Marina Kogan](http://www.mkoganresearch.com/) and [Alexander Lex](https://www.alexander-lex.net/). Last summer, I was fortunate to intern with [Tableau Research](https://www.tableau.com/research).

I am broadly interested in _human-data interaction_ and _data visualization_. 
My research focuses on how people interpret and misinterpret, frame and reframe data and charts. 
My goal is to make charts and data portals more useful, understandable, and transparent.

**I am looking for academic & industry research positions starting Fall 2025---please reach out!.**
You can access my CV [here](/files/lisnic_cv.pdf).
