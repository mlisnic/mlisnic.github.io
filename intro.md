My name is Maxim Lisnic and I am a Ph.D. student in Human-Centered
Computing at the University of Utah's
[Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/). I
am advised by [Marina Kogan](http://www.mkoganresearch.com/) and [Alexander Lex](https://www.alexander-lex.net/). This summer, I'm interning with [Tableau Research](https://www.tableau.com/research).

I am broadly interested in _human-data interaction_ and _data visualization_. My research focuses on how people interpret, misinterpret, reframe, communicate with, and even spread misinformation with data and charts.
