Last summer, I was fortunate to intern with Tableau Research.\nI am broadly interested in human-data interaction and data visualization. My research focuses on how people interpret and misinterpret, frame and reframe data and charts. My goal is to make charts and data portals more useful, understandable, and transparent.\nI am looking for academic & industry research positions starting Fall 2025—please reach out!. You can access my CV here."
