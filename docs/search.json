Last summer, I was fortunate to intern with Tableau Research.\nI am broadly interested in human-data interaction and data visualization. My research focuses on how people interpret, misinterpret, reframe, communicate with, and even spread misinformation with data and charts. I am looking for post-doc and full-time opportunities starting Fall 2025.\nYou can access my CV here."
